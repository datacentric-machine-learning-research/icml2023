Chelsea Finn is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering at Stanford University. Her research interests lie in the capability of robots and other agents to develop broadly intelligent behavior through learning and interaction. To this end, her work has pioneered end-to-end deep learning methods for vision-based robotic manipulation, meta-learning algorithms for few-shot learning, and approaches for scaling robot learning to broad datasets. Her research has been recognized by awards such as the Sloan Fellowship, the IEEE RAS Early Academic Career Award, and the ACM doctoral dissertation award, and has been covered by various media outlets including the New York Times, Wired, and Bloomberg. Prior to Stanford, she received her Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at MIT and her PhD in Computer Science at UC Berkeley.
