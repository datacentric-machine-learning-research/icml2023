I am an Assistant Professor in the Computer Science Department at UCLA, where I lead the BigML research group. My research aims to address sustainability, reliability, and efficiency of machine learning. I am mainly working on improving the big data quality, by developing theoretically rigorous methods to select the most beneficial data for efficient and robust learning. Before joining UCLA, I was a postdoctoral research fellow in Computer Science at Stanford University, and received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from ETH Zurich. I received an ETH medal for Outstanding Doctoral Thesis, was selected as a Rising Star in EECS by MIT, and received an NSF Career Award and a UCLA Helman fellows award.
