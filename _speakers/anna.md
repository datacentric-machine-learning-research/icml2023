Anna Khoreva is a Senior Research Manager at the Bosch Center for Artificial Intelligence (BCAI), leading the group on Generalization in Deep Learning. Her research interests lie in developing reliable models with good generalization ability while obtaining the necessary supervision and guidance in a cost-effective way, with a particular focus on generative AI, self-supervised and weakly supervised learning. Anna has been the head of the Bosch Industry-on-Campus Lab on Data-Efficient Deep Learning at the University of Tübingen for 3 years since 2020. Prior to joining Bosch in 2018, she was a postdoctoral researcher in the Computer Vision and Machine Learning group at the Max Planck Institute for Informatics. She obtained her PhD in Computer Science at Max-Planck Institute for Informatics in 2017 under the supervision of Bernt Schiele, with a focus on weakly supervised learning for image and video segmentation, and received an Honour’s M.Sc. in Visual Computing from the Saarland University in 2014.
