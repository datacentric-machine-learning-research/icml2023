Tim Salimans is a generative modeling researcher at Google DeepMind Amsterdam. His contributions include fundamental work on VAE, GANs, and generative model evaluation using the Inception Score. Most recently his focus has been on diffusion models, which he's used to build foundation models for images and video, and for which he's proposed efficient inference techniques such as progressive distillation and classifier-free guidance.
