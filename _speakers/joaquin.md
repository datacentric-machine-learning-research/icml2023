Joaquin Vanschoren is an Assistant Professor of Machine Learning at the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). His research focuses on the progressive automation of machine learning. He founded and leads OpenML.org, an open science platform allowing scientists to share datasets and train many machine learning models from many software tools in a frictionless yet principled way. It also organizes all results online, providing detailed insight into the performance of machine learning techniques, and allowing a more scientific, data-driven approach to building new machine learning systems. Subsequently, he uses this knowledge to create automatic machine learning (AutoML) techniques that learn from these experiments to help people build better models, faster, or automate the process entirely.
