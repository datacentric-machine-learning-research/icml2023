Thomas is a postdoctoral researcher in the Medical Data Science group at ETH Zurich, where he works on multimodal generative models and the differentiability of discrete algorithms and distributions. Before starting my PhD at ETH Zurich, he worked at Logitech as a software engineer in the consumer video unit and for upicto, a Zurich-based start-up where he worked on camera-based visibility estimation in collaboration with MeteoSwiss.
