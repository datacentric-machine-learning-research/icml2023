All authors and submissions should adhere to the [ICLR policy](https://www.iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide).

* We welcome two types of paper submissions:
  * **Research papers**: up to 8 pages (not including references and appendices). Acceptable material includes original and high-quality unpublished contributions to the theory, practical aspects, as well as position papers relevant to the workshop topics.
  * **Extended abstracts**: up to 2 pages (not including references and appendices). Acceptable material includes work which has already been submitted or published, preliminary results and controversial findings.
* Posting all versions of a paper that is submitted to DMLR workshop, on preprint servers like ArXiv is permitted. Once the paper is accepted, the preprint version should be marked with the publication information.
* The use of LLMs is allowed as a general-purpose writing assist tool. Authors should understand that they take full responsibility for the contents of their papers, including content generated by LLMs that could be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct (e.g., fabrication of facts). LLMs are not eligible for authorship.
​* ​Authors who choose to create new datasets must provide access to the datasets (view and download) to help reviewers assess submitted works. We strongly encourage authors to submit supplementary material (as a separate PDF) including:
  * Data Card: we recommend authors to check [data card template](https://sites.research.google/datacardsplaybook/).
  * Data Sheet: Check a [datasheet example](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09010).
* Authors are strongly encouraged to include a paragraph-long [Reproducibility Statement](https://www.iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide) at the end of the main text (before references) to discuss the efforts that have been made to ensure reproducibility. This optional reproducibility statement will not count toward the page limit, but should not be more than 1 page. We encourage authors to check [model card template](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.03993).
* Submissions should adhere to the DMLR style templates: [Latex template](https://github.com/JmlrOrg/dmlr-style-file)
* Submissions are only accepted in written English.
* All papers must be proofread (not just spell-checked) by the authors before submission.

* **Submission URL: [https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2024/Workshop/DMLR](https://openreview.net/group?id=ICLR.cc/2024/Workshop/DMLR) (The submission site is open.)**

### DMLR Journal
The [Journal of Data-centric Machine Learning Research (DMLR)](https://data.mlr.press/) is the latest member of the JMLR family, aiming to provide a top archival venue for high-quality scholarly articles focused on the data aspect of machine learning research. The top submissions to the DMLR workshops will be invited to submit extended version of their paper to the DMLR journal.
