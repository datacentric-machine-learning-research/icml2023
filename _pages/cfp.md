All authors and submissions should adhere to the [ICLR policy](https://www.iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide).

* We welcome three types of paper submissions:
  * **Research papers:** up to 8 pages (not including references and appendices). Acceptable material includes original and high-quality unpublished contributions to the theory, practical aspects, as well as position papers relevant to the workshop topics.
  * **Extended abstracts:** up to 2 pages (not including references and appendices). Acceptable material includes work which has already been submitted or published, preliminary results and controversial findings.<br>
* Posting all versions of a paper (with the exception of the final published version) that is submitted to DMLR workshop, on preprint servers like ArXiv is permitted. Once the paper is accepted, the preprint version should be marked with the publication information including DOI.
* All submissions must represent original work and not previously published elsewhere.
* Concurrent submission of papers to a conference/journal (involving identical or substantially similar work) is not permitted.
* The use of LLMs is allowed as a general-purpose writing assist tool.  Authors should understand that they take full responsibility for the contents of their papers, including content generated by LLMs that could be construed as plagiarism or scientific misconduct (e.g., fabrication of facts).  LLMs are not eligible for authorship.
* Authors are strongly encouraged to include a paragraph-long [Reproducibility Statement](https://www.iclr.cc/Conferences/2024/AuthorGuide) at the end of the main text (before references) to discuss the efforts that have been made to ensure reproducibility. This optional reproducibility statement will not count toward the page limit, but should not be more than 1 page
* Submissions should adhere to the DMLR style templates: [Latex template](https://github.com/JmlrOrg/dmlr-style-file)
* Submissions are only accepted in written English.
* All papers must be proofread (not just spell checked) by the authors before submission.
